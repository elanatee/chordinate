# chordinate
**chordinate** is a command-line program written in Python that quizzes users on chords commonly used in classical music - [fully diminished seventh chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_seventh_chord) and the [cadential 6/4](http://www.harmony.org.uk/book/voice_leading/cadential_6_4.htm). this project was inspired by the several rules for chord resolutions studied in music theory II (MUSC 2146).
