# chordinate
**chordinate** is a command-line program written in Python that quizzes users on chords commonly used in classical music - [fully diminished seventh chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_seventh_chord) and the [cadential 6/4](https://astro.temple.edu/~tub70784/mtnm2/cadential64.html). this project was created as a study aid for the several rules for chord resolutions studied in music theory II (MUSC 2146).
